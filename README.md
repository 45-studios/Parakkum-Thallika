Parakkum Thallika (The Flying Saucer) - Disaster Drone Management UI Prototype.

Overview"Parakkum Thallika" is an educational and research prototype for a Disaster Drone Management 

User Interface (UI). Developed by the Disaster Drone Management Group for 45-STDIOS, this project serves as a conceptual model for operating and managing autonomous drones in emergency and disaster scenarios.

NOTE: This website and its contents are developed solely for educational and research purposes. This is not a live operational system.

Key Features (Prototype Goals)Platform Specific UIs: Dedicated interfaces optimized for Mobile (2-mobile.html) and PC (3-pc.html) use.

Intuitive Control: Core UI elements designed to simulate basic drone functions such as Autopilot control and location/destination setting.

Real-time Monitoring Mockup: Placeholder sections for viewing simulated drone status, video feeds, and system diagnostics.

Setup and Access :This project is deployed via GitHub Pages and requires no local setup to view.

Acknowledgments and Code Contributions

This project was built upon collaborative effort and leveraging open-source resources, which is essential for rapid prototyping and learning.

Core Code Reference (Remote Control Interface)We extend our sincere gratitude to ui-code for their foundational work on remote control interfaces.

The structure and conceptual basis for the control panel elements in this project were inspired by and modified from the open-source code found here:Repository: ui-code/RemoteControl

Contribution: The index.html and style.css files from this repository provided a critical starting point for developing the responsive and tactile control UI necessary for the drone interface.

AI AssistanceThe development process for this project was significantly enhanced through the use of generative AI tools.

AI Model (Gemini): This assistance was provided by Gemini, a large language model from Google.

Contribution: Gemini provided support in several critical areas, including:Generating the initial README and project documentation.Offering structural critique and review of the deployed website.

Providing best practices guidance on web development, security (e.g., .env file management), and Git workflows.

This combination of open-source inspiration and AI-powered development assistance allowed the team to focus on the unique educational aspects of the Disaster Drone Management UI.

Thank you for using this software
